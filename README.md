Site Inventory Tracker
==============
Site Inventory Tracker is a Spring application for scraping websites for inventory, prices and other things and stored in a searchable database.

This is primarily an experiment to fill a need for me in monitoring inventory and price levels, and not really intended for production use.

It will built on:

* Spring 3.2
* Spring Data
* Postgres 9.1
* Hibernate 4.2.1
* Running on Tomcat 7
